## 🏁 Introduction

This project invites you to document and provide the audio for a podcast on the
topic of picking an academic major at an undergraduate institution like
Allegheny College. In addition to writing all of the required content in the
file
[writing/characterization/podcast_audio_identity.md](writing/characterization/podcast_audio_identity.md),
you will practice the use of `git` and GitHub and learn how to check the
writing in a Markdown file through the use of tools like the
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs the
automated grading checks provided by
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).

Please note that the content provided in the `README.md` file for this GitHub
repository is an overview of the project and thus may not include the details
for every step needed to successfully complete every project deliverable. This
means that you may need to schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours to discuss aspects of this project. Finally, it is important to
point out that your repository for this project was created from the GitHub
repository template called
[exposition-engineering-show-audio-starter](https://github.com/ExpositionEngineering/exposition-engineering-show-audio-starter);
you can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation
or source code!

## 🤝 Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as an exposition engineer is to search for and then understand
and ultimately apply the technical writing content found in additional resources.

## 🛫 Project Overview

This assignment invites you to create a show outline for a podcast on the topic
of picking an academic major at an institution like Allegheny College. You must
read all of the `TODO` markers inside of the `podcast_audio_identity.md` file
and write the content and take the steps that they require. Once you are
finished with your description of the podcast's audio identify you should use
the pull request review mechanism built into GitHub to request that the course
instructor and one other member of the class review your work. Next, both you
and the peer reviewers will collaboratively complete one or more rounds of
review of your audio identity statement before you create your logo.

Along with documenting the audio identity of your podcast, you should also
create a logo for it using Canva. You should then add the logo to the `images/`
directory and then update the `podcast_audio_identity.md` file to include a
reference to the logo stored in your GitHub repository. Importantly, please note
that you will need to use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands
to ensure that your podcast logo is stored in your GitHub repository. Finally,
you need to make sure that your podcast logo has the following characteristics:

- The name of the file must be `podcast_audio.png`
- The file must be in the `audio/` directory
- The file must be of the `mp3` format
- The file must be playable with both desktop and mobile audio players
- The file must be covered for legal use in a public podcast (e.g., Creative Commons or public domain)

## 🐊 Project Assessment

Please keep in mind the following reminders as you consider how the course
instructor will assess the final version of your project:

- If you have already installed the
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs the
automated grading checks provided by
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) you can, from the
repository's base directory, run the automated grading checks by typing
`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`.
- You may also review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions.
Please note that if all of the GatorGrader checks do not pass, then your GitHub
Actions build will not pass either. You need to make sure that you have a
passing build in GitHub Actions before the project's due date.
- The GitHub repository that houses this project has a GitHub Actions
configuration that will report to you through the GitHub Actions tab a summary
of the key results from running the assessment. You can check this tab to
quickly see which the status of the GatorGrader checks and to review a report
about the coverage of the test suite that accompanies the project.
- Don't forget that you must provide all of the required responses to the
technical writing prompts in the
`writing/characterization/podcast_audio_identity.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
labels from all of the provided source code and technical writing. This means
that instead of only deleting and/or rewriting the `TODO` marker from the file
you should delete the `TODO` marker and the entire prompt and then add your own
content to demonstrate that you understand all aspects of this project.
- Please remember that passing the baseline checks that are run through the
GatorGrader tool is not a guarantee that you will earn the highest possible
grade on this assignment. This is due to the fact that the course instructor
will also check, for instance, the quality of your writing and confirm, for
instance, the absence of any spelling or grammar mistakes.
